# DifferentPhoneticsDetection_NLP
# Introduction 
This project is about finding different forms of reading a sentence.
There were different ways ti implement this such as using recursive function, trees, dynamic programming etc..
Here I implemented this by a recursive function which has an efficient run time...
The performance and explanation of my code is ecplained breifly below(also in comments of my code)
At first I assemble the phonetic of whole sentence together and then I try to find all the possible subtrings.
I seperate a substring and check wether it is in my dictionary or not and also I have to check recursively wether the remaining parts may make meaning ful words or not...

I have put my codes in p1/src . My main files are `main.py` and `datamapping.py` and I have also a script to run them named `run_script.py` which will be explained later .
In p1/out I have my outout files which contains `phonetics_states.txt` and `final_answer.txt`.
Actually the final output is in`final_answer.txt`.
In p1/in I have the `Entries.csv` which is a comma seperated data set and in the tests folder there exists some test cases of input and output.

# Dependencies
All you need is python3 :))
##### Notice the version should be only 3!
(because of the differnces between python 2 and python3 in ASCCII chars)

# Getting Started
Here is how you can run my project:
``` 
python run_script_py textfilename
```

###### No need to add format (.txt etc)

# Test
The only thing you have to notic is that you should put you test data in tests folder because of the structure of my script.
